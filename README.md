# Ms-Pac-Cube
Based on a dream I had when I was a little kid.

In the dream, I was playing a Ms. Pac-Man arcade game, but it only had one button, and Ms. Pac-Man was a cube.

Therefore, in Ms. Pac-Cube, you only have one button, and it's the spacebar. Press it to turn Ms. Pac-Man 90 degrees clockwise.
As you progress through the levels, you'll meet familiar faces, such as Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde, as well as not-so-familiar faces, like Sue, Funky and Spunky. Get to a high-enough level and you'll be able to face off against the Dark Lord of Ghosts himself, Betrayus!

To do list:

-unfuck ghost collision, ghosts are passing through walls

-add Sue, Funky and Spunky

-figure out when Betrayus will show up

-add music

-implement more mazes (done)

-unfuck the controls
